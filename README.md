setup
=====

A simple attempt to automate my setup

---

This repository contains a script which pimps a clean mac osx mavericks-installation
into a workstation ready to do stuff!

Mainly, it does:
- Install [homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew)
- Install [homebrew-cask](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask)
- Install [my personal dotfiles](https://github.com/engeld/dotfiles)
  - Symlinks all my dotfiles into its places
- Install homebrew apps (according to my [Brewfile](https://github.com/engeld/dotfiles/blob/master/Brewfile))
- Install homebrew-cask apps
