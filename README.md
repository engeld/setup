setup
=====

A simple attempt to automate my setup

---

This repository contains a script which pimps a clean mac osx mavericks-installation
into a workstation ready to do stuff!

Mainly, it does:
- Install homebrew
- Install homebrew-cask
- Install my personal dotfiles
  - Symlinks all my dotfiles into its places
- Install homebrew apps (according to my Brewfile)
- Install homebrew-cask apps
